1. Analysis Of Customers
   
  The first slide presents an analysis of customers purchasing at the store, divided by gender, income, and age. I placed this slide first because one of the most important factors for the successful operation of the store is the people who make purchases there.

4. Analysis of Costs
   
   The following slide demonstrates that the company generates profits from each product because sales profits always exceed production costs.

5. Grouping According To Territory
    
   The next two slides illustrate profits and the numbers of ordered products, segmented by territory. This is a crucial slide showing in which regions sales are lower, thus prompting consideration of changes to enhance products tailored to local residents.

6. Grouping By The Time
    
   This slide shows how sales change over the years, months, days in a month, and weeks, allowing us to identify when sales are highest and when additional advertising actions can be considered to level up sales.

   The last slide presents an analysis of employees, who are the foundation of the store's operations and its profits. The slide contains key information, including the average salary of employees in a given position, the number of employees, and the average age of individuals starting work in that position, which can be helpful for those applying for a position in the company.
